# Backup

Server backups are critical for ensuring data security, operational continuity, and compliance. Backup ensures the following:

- Protection against data loss due to hardware failure and human error
- Acts as a backbone during disaster recovery caused by natural disasters or cyberattacks
- Ensures business continuity by minimizing downtime and quickly restoring the system in case of failure

Regular backups ensure data security, business resilience, and regulatory compliance, making them an essential part of any IT strategy.

Angel Medical has a dedicated physical server for backup operations, and a scheduled backup is configured with Windows Backup to run daily at 9 PM.

Below is a configuration of the backup operations and success rate:
