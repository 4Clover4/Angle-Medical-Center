|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Set Strong Passwords**                  | Set strong passwords for management access to prevent unauthorized access.      | `enable secret <strong-password>`                                                                                                                      |
| **Enable SSH for Remote Management**      | Disable Telnet and use SSH for encrypted remote access.                         | `ip ssh version 2`                                                                                                                                      |
| **Disable Unused Ports**                  | Disable unused ports to prevent unauthorized devices from accessing the network. | `interface range f 0/12 - 20` <br> `shutdown`                                                                                         |
| **Port Security (MAC Address Limiting)**  | Limit the number of allowed MAC addresses per port to prevent MAC address spoofing. | `switchport port-security` <br> `switchport port-security maximum 2`                                                                                   |
| **Port Security (Violation Action)**      | Define what happens when a security violation occurs, like an unknown MAC address. | `switchport port-security violation **restrict**`                                                                                                          |
| **Port Security (Sticky MAC Addresses)**  | Allow the switch to dynamically learn and bind MAC addresses to a port.         | `switchport port-security mac-address **sticky**`                                                                                                          |
| **Enable BPDU Guard**                     | Protect against malicious STP attacks by disabling BPDU on vulnerable ports.     | `spanning-tree **bpduguard** enable`                                                                                                                       |
| **Disable CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)**| Prevent revealing network topology by disabling CDP.                            | `no cdp run`                                                                                                                                           |
| **Trunk Port Security**                   | Restrict allowed VLANs on trunk ports to avoid unauthorized VLAN traffic.        | `switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100` |

####  
Switch hardening ensures that only authorized devices can access the network by limiting port access, protecting management access with strong encryption, and preventing network topology exposure.

The **switchport port-security violation restrict** command specifies that if a security violation occurs (such as when an unauthorized MAC address is detected), the port will restrict the connection rather than shutting it down. The port will continue to function, but any traffic from unauthorized MAC addresses will be dropped, and a log entry will be created. This option is useful to avoid disrupting network connectivity while still enforcing security.
The **restrict** option is chosen over `shutdown` or `protect` because it prevents unauthorized devices from accessing the network without disabling the entire port, allowing for continued operation but with more controlled access.

The **switchport port-security mac-address sticky** command enables the switch to dynamically learn and save the MAC addresses of devices connected to the port. These learned MAC addresses are then stored in the running configuration, allowing the switch to automatically permit these addresses in future connections.

The **spanning-tree bpduguard enable** command protects the network by disabling a port if it receives a Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU), preventing potential spanning tree loops caused by unauthorized devices.

The command **no cdp run** disables the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) on a device, preventing it from sending or receiving CDP information, which is used for discovering neighboring Cisco devices and their details.

### **Router Hardening Security Measures**

| **Security Action**                       | **Description**                                                                  | **Example Command**                                                                                                                                          |

| **Enable NAT (Network Address Translation)**| Protect internal networks by translating private IP addresses to public ones.    | `ip nat inside source list 1 interface gigabitEthernet 0/0 *overload*` <br> `access-list 1 permit 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255`                                 |
| **OSPF Hardening**                        | Use authentication to secure OSPF communications between routers.                | `router **ospf** 66` <br> `area 0 `                                                                                              |
| **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**           | Control traffic flow to prevent unauthorized access between networks.           | `access-list 130 deny ip 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255`                                                                                  |

####  
Router hardening focuses on securing management access, reducing unnecessary attack surfaces, and protecting the internal network by utilizing NAT, ACLs, and secure routing protocols like OSPF.

The **overload** keyword in the command `ip nat inside source list 1 interface gigabitEthernet 0/0 overload` enables Port Address Translation (PAT), allowing multiple internal devices to share a single public IP address. Each deviceâ€™s connection is distinguished by a unique port number, saving public IP addresses.

**OSPF** (Open Shortest Path First) is a link-state routing protocol used to find the best path for data exchange in an IP network, by calculating the shortest path first based on the network's topology.
                                                                                          |

####  
Securing protocols ensures that sensitive information like passwords and routing updates are transmitted securely. Encryption and authentication mechanisms prevent unauthorized interception.
